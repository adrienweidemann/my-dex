> MyDex - Next.JS app

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Prerequisites

- node 18
- npm 9

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Author's note

This project is based on my personal projects. You'll maybe found code remainder or some logic that is pretty overkill for this project.
But I want to show how I usually work, what I like to implement in my projects and learn new things.

I was inspired by the configuration of Airbnb linters for this project (https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
I use Husky as Git hook to prevent code to be pushed if tests doesn't work or if code has not been linted (https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/).
It's just a tool, so I didn't take a lot of time to configure, I think we can improve it usage.

Project's architecture is custom, based on my experiences and documentation I found on Internet. Same for test's guidelines.
I'm really open to every constructive comments to improve myself.

I wish you a nice day.
